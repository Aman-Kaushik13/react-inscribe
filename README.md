## Setting up Dev environment
> NOTE: We use yarn as the primary package manager. Please do not use npm to install your packages

- `cd core`.
- `yarn install` to install dependencies.
- `yarn start`. This will start compiling the code in `src/` into the `dist/` folder and will watch for any changes and recompile.
- `cd core/example`. We will test our project in this folder by importing react-inscribe with yarn's `link` feature.
- `yarn install` in the example folder.
- `yarn start`. This will start the React development server and watch for changes and update. You can now make changes in `core/src` to make changes the `react-inscribe` library and use the `core/example` to test it.
